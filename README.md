## Current Status
The Python app provides functionality of the features / algorithms, but there's no interaction with the frontend yet. 
The frontend currently only serves as a demonstration of what the user interface will look like when connecting with the backend.
## Future Improvements
- **Integrating frontend and backend** for a fully function website.
- **Community Features**: Implementing user accounts, so that the users can save the outfits, see the past suggestions, interact with the community.
- **Additional features**: recommendation system based on user history / preferences, additional outfit categories.
- **Pictures**: allowing users to upload and receive suggestions in pictures.
- **Database**: to store user profiles / actions.
- **API**: to handle requests and return outfit suggestions in a structured format (JSON)
